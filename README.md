# dbass

DBASS stands for Database of Aberrant Splice Sites. It contains examples of variants that cause aberrant splicing by activating abnormal splice sites.

This can happen either through the creation of a de novo splice site, or the activation of a pre-existing cryptic splice site.

This repo currently only contains DBASS5, i.e. donor splice sites.
